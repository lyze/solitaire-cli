CIS 190 Final Project
Authors: David Xu and Connie Yuan
Alpha Submission

Run:
Start program running "make" and then running "solitaire" executable

Alpha Goals:
1) Cards laid out correctly
   - Program successfully displays the board at the beginning of game
   - Board follows the rules of klondike solitaire 
2) Receive and act on user commands
   - Prompts users for 4 commands and read commands

Implementation:
Program was started separately but most changes were implemented in
a pair programming session.

Compilation Error Note:
Our code currently does not work on eniac, because eniac does not support
c++ version 4.8. Therefore, it throws errors for some parts of our code
in board.h.
